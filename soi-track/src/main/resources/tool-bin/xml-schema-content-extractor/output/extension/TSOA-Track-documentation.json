      "A TSOA Track of observation acts. An observation act is 'associated with a discrete time instant or period through which results are assigned' to features-of-interest. 'An observation involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some feature.'
